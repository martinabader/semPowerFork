\value{
A list containing the implied variance-covariance matrix (Sigma), the loading matrix (Lambda), the factor-covariance matrix (Phi) or the slopes (Beta) and the residual variances (Psi), the variance-covariance matrix between the manifest residuals (Theta), the implied indicator means (mu), intercepts (tau), and latent means (Alpha), as well as the associated lavaan model string defining the population (modelPop) and two lavaan models string defining a corresponding true (modelTrue) or pure cfa analysis model (modelTrueCFA) omitting any regression relationships.
}
\description{
Generate a covariance matrix (and mean vector) and associated lavaan model strings based on defined model features.

\details{
This function generates the variance-covariance matrix of the \eqn{p} observed variables \eqn{\Sigma} and their means \eqn{\mu} via a confirmatory factor (CFA) model or a more general structural equation model. 

In the CFA model, 
\deqn{\Sigma = \Lambda \Phi \Lambda' + \Theta}
where \eqn{\Lambda} is the \eqn{p \cdot m} loading matrix, \eqn{\Phi} is the variance-covariance matrix of the \eqn{m} factors, and \eqn{\Theta} is the residual variance-covariance matrix of the observed variables. The means are
\deqn{\mu = \tau + \Lambda \alpha}
with the \eqn{p} indicator intercepts \eqn{\tau} and the \eqn{m} factor means \eqn{\alpha}.

In the structural equation model, 
\deqn{\Sigma = \Lambda (I - \Beta)^{-1} \Psi [(I - \Beta)^{-1}]'  \Lambda' + \Theta } 
where \eqn{\Beta} is the \eqn{m \cdot m} matrix containing the regression slopes and \eqn{\Psi} is the (residual) variance-covariance matrix of the \eqn{m} factors. The means are
\deqn{\mu = \tau + \Lambda (I - \Beta)^{-1} \alpha}

In either model, the meanstructure can be omitted, leading to factors with zero means and zero intercepts. 

When \eqn{\Lambda = I}, the models above do not contain any factors and reduce to ordinary regression or path models.  

If `Phi` is defined, a CFA model is used, if `Beta` is defined, a structural equation model. 
When both `Phi` and `Beta` are NULL, a CFA model is used with \eqn{\Phi = I}, i.e., uncorrelated factors.
When `Phi` is a single number, all factor correlations are equal to this number.

When `Beta` is defined and `Psi` is NULL, \eqn{\Psi = I}.

When `Theta` is NULL, \eqn{\Theta} is a diagonal matrix with all elements such that the variances of the observed variables are 1. When there is only a single observed indicator for a factor, the corresponding element in \eqn{\Theta} is set to zero.

Instead of providing the loading matrix \eqn{\Lambda} via `Lambda`, there are several shortcuts:
\itemize{
\item `loadings`: defines the primary loadings for each factor in a list structure, e. g. `loadings = list(c(.5, .4, .6), c(.8, .6, .6, .4))` defines a two factor model with three indicators loading on the first factor by .5, , 4., and .6, and four indicators loading in the second factor by .8, .6, .6, and .4.  
\item `nIndicator`: used in conjunction with `loadM` or `loadMinmax`, defines the number of indicators by factor, e. g., `nIndicator = c(3, 4)` defines a two factor model with three and four indicators for the first and second factor, respectively. `nIndicator` can also be a single number to define the same number of indicators for each factor. 
\item `loadM`: defines the mean loading either for all indicators (if a single number is provided) or separately for each factor (if a vector is provided), e. g. `loadM = c(.5, .6)` defines the mean loadings of the first factor to equal .5 and those of the second factor do equal .6
\item `loadSD`: used in conjunction with `loadM`, defines the standard deviations of the loadings. If omitted or NULL, the standard deviations are zero. Otherwise, the loadings are sampled from a normal distribution with N(loadM, loadSD) for each factor. 
\item `loadMinMax`: defines the minimum and maximum loading either for all factors or separately for each factor (as a list). The loadings are then sampled from a uniform distribution. For example, `loadMinMax = list(c(.4, .6), c(.4, .8))` defines the loadings for the first factor lying between .4 and .6, and those for the second factor between .4 and .8.
