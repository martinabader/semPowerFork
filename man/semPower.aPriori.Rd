\arguments{
\item{effect}{effect size specifying the discrepancy between H0 and H1 (a list for multiple group models)}

\item{effect.measure}{type of effect, one of "F0", "RMSEA", "Mc", "GFI", AGFI"}

\item{alpha}{alpha error}

\item{beta}{beta error; set either beta or power}

\item{power}{power (1-beta); set either beta or power}

\item{N}{a list of sample weights for multiple group power analyses, e.g. list(1,2) to make the second group twice as large as the first one}

\item{df}{the model degrees of freedom}

\item{p}{the number of observed variables, required for effect.measure = "GFI" and "AGFI"}

\item{SigmaHat}{model implied covariance matrix (a list for multiple group models). Use in conjuntion with Sigma to define effect and effect.measure.}

\item{Sigma}{population covariance matrix (a list for multiple group models). Use in conjuntion with SigmaHat to define effect and effect.measure.}
