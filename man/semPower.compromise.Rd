\arguments{
\item{effect}{effect size specifying the discrepancy between H0 and H1  (a list for multiple group models)}

\item{effect.measure}{type of effect, one of "F0","RMSEA", "Mc", "GFI", AGFI"}

\item{abratio}{the ratio of alpha to beta}

\item{N}{the number of observations  (a list for multiple group models)}

\item{df}{the model degrees of freedom}

\item{p}{the number of observed variables, required for effect.measure = "GammaHat", "GFI",  and "AGFI"}

\item{SigmaHat}{model implied covariance matrix (a list for multiple group models). Use in conjuntion with Sigma to define effect and effect.measure.}

\item{Sigma}{population covariance matrix (a list for multiple group models). Use in conjuntion with SigmaHat to define effect and effect.measure.}

\description{
Performs a compromise power analysis, i.e. determines the critical chi-square along with the implied alpha and beta, given a specified alpha/beta ratio, effect, N, and df
